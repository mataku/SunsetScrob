    <blockquote>
      CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT
      PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES
      NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS
      PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE

    </blockquote>
    <h3><em>Statement of Purpose</em></h3>
    <p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world
      automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights
      (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each
      and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or
      a database (each, a "Work").</p>
    <p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights
      to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of
      creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the
      public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
      infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works,
      reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
      whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
      commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the
      Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
      production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to
      gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part
      through the use and efforts of others.</p>
    <p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and
      without any expectation of additional consideration or
      compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the
      "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
      Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects
      to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work
      under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
      Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
      effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Copyright and Related Rights.</strong>
      A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by
      copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
      Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but
      are not limited to, the following:
    </p>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform,
        display, communicate, and translate a Work;
      </li>
      <li> moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
        performer(s);
      </li>
      <li>publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's
        image or likeness depicted in a Work;
      </li>
      <li>rights protecting against unfair competition in regards
        to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a),
        below;
      </li>
      <li>rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and
        reuse of data in a Work;
      </li>
      <li>database rights (such as those arising under Directive
        96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
        March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under
        any national implementation thereof, including any amended
        or successor version of such directive); and
      </li>
      <li>other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights
        throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
        any national implementations thereof.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>2. Waiver.</strong> To the greatest extent
      permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
      Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
      unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
      Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims
      and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
      existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
      the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
      maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
      (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
      future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
      purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
      advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
      makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public
      at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
      successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be
      subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination,
      or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
      enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by
      Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3. Public License Fallback.</strong> Should any
      part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
      ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be
      preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
      Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
      extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each
      affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
      sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
      license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
      in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
      maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
      (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
      future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
      purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
      advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The
      License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
      applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
      License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
      ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
      ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
      License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or
      she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
      Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
      associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
      Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement
      of Purpose.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Limitations and Disclaimers.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are
        waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise
        affected by this document.
      </li>
      <li>Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no
        representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
        Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including
        without limitation warranties of title, merchantability,
        fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the
        absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present
        or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
        the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
      </li>
      <li>Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of
        other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof,
        including without limitation any person's Copyright and
        Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims
        responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
        permissions or other rights required for any use of the
        Work.
      </li>
      <li>Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative
        Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or
        obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.
